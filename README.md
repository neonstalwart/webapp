# Dojo Single Page Application

This is a sample single page application build with Dojo.  It is based on the scaffolding produced by [generator-dojo](https://github.com/bryanforbes/generator-dojo) and demonstrates how to use `dojo/router` with a `dijit/layout/StackContainer` to lazily load pages as the user navigates through the application.
